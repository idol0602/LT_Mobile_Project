// Central API base - change this to the IP/host your DataServer is reachable at from the device
export const API_BASE = "http://localhost:5050"; // DataServer running on localhost:5050

// Notes:
// - When testing on a physical device, set this to your machine IP (where DataServer runs).
// - When testing on emulator, you may need to use emulator loopback (10.0.2.2 for Android emulator).
